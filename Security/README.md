* ## Project 2
	* ### Overview
This project is a simulation of a Red Team vs Blue Team scenario, where both the role of pentester and SOC analyst were played.

As the red team a vulnerable VM was attacked, ultimately resulting in root access to the machine. As the Blue Team, Kibana was used to review logs captured during the attack, these logs were then used to extract hard data and create visualizations for the final report.

The log data was then interpreted in order to suggest mitigation strategies for each exploit that was successfully performed.
